# Job Queue Project by Calvin Truong

### Please Note:
  * MongoDB is the database used for my project
  * Server attempts to connect to a local instance of MongoDB, so MongoDB should be installed and running.
  * You can download MongoDB here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community
  * After it is downloaded, you can navigate to `<mongodb-install-location>/bin` and start the `mongod` process.
  * A local instance of MongoDB should be running, and then you are good to go for starting up the server!
  * Navigate to the root folder of my project, and run `node server.js`
  * Server is listening on port 3000, so type `localhost:3000` in a web browser to use the application!
  
Please feel free to ask me any questions! Thank you.
